**Description:**

The 5 Elements form is filled with simple and gentle movements which can be mastered within a short period of time.

Tai Chi can be a very effective form of health training; utilizing the physical, mental and spiritual dimensions of our being.

Within a Tai Chi class the student studies the physical movements as well as breath work and meditation. Benefits include improved circulation, balance and posture, an increase in strength, flexibility and reduced stress. Tai Chi is appropriate for any person regardless of their physical condition. This class offers both a seated and a standing practice.

Due to the minimal amount of steps and their repetition the Five Elements form can be learned quickly and incorporated into a daily practice.
